# Tools

<p> Here's a summary of the tools used in this project and their versions.</p>
<p>A deep dive of each dependency is available at 'LINK'.</p>

## Runtime tools

<ToolsTable type="production" />

### @prisma/client

<p>
  This is the Prisma client. It's used to actually perform the connection and
  queries to the database.
</p>

### bcrypt

<p>This is a popular cryptography tool.</p>
<p>
  Currently we only use it to hash the user's password with a salt before
  storing them in the database.
</p>

### body-parser

<p>
  This is a <code>Express</code> middleware used to parse the http requests
  bodies from text to JSON.
</p>

### dotenv

<p>
  This is a library used to populate <code>proccess.env.*</code> using a
  template file. E.g.: <code>.env</code>
</p>

### express

<p>This is a popular and battle tested web framework.</p>
<p>
  We currently use it for handling low level http (requests, responses, headers,
  etc).
</p>

### helmet

<p>
  This is collection of <code>Express</code> middlewares that ensures the bare
  minimum security gotchas when it comes to web servers.
</p>
<p>
  E.g.: It removes the <code>X-Powered-By</code> header from the http responses,
  so we don't spoil what web framework we are using, preventing attackers to
  apply tool specific sploits.
</p>

### http-status-codes

<p>This is a simply tool to help readability of the HTTP status codes.</p>
<p>It provides all HTTP status through constants and also some util helpers.</p>
<p>
  E.g.: <code>HttpStatusCode.BAD_REQUEST</code>
</p>

### inversify

<p>
  This is our <i>IoC container</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, we use it in our <i>Composition Root</i> in the main layer, to
  handle creation of instances and their scopes.
</p>

### reflect-metadata

<p>
  This is a peer dependency of <code>inversify</code> and it's necessary to
  perform runtime reflection on types.
</p>

### tsconfig-paths

<p>
  This library allow us use to use TypeScript path aliases in production, so our
  transpiled JavaScript files know how to resolve the path aliased modules at
  runtime.
</p>

<p>
  E.g.: <code>import SignUpUseCase from '@data/usecases';</code>
</p>

### yup

<p>This is validation library based in schemas.</p>
<p>
  It's very useful at our <i>Presentation Layer</i> where we do the schema
  validation of the inputs.
</p>
<p>
  Remember, it's only <b>Schema</b> validation, not <b>Domain</b> validation.
</p>
<p>
  Domain validation like verify uniqueness of an email is done at the{' '}
  <code>Data Layer</code>
</p>
