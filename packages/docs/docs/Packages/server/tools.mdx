# Tools

Here's a summary of the tools used in this project and their versions.

A deep dive of each dependency is available at 'LINK'.

## Runtime tools

<ToolsTable type="production" />

### @prisma/client

This is the Prisma client. It's used to actually perform the connection and
queries to the database.

### bcrypt

This is a popular cryptography tool.

Currently we only use it to hash the user's password with a salt before
storing them in the database.

### body-parser

This is a `Express` middleware used to parse the http requests
bodies from text to JSON.

### dotenv

This is a library used to populate `proccess.env.\*` using a
template file. E.g.: `.env`

### express

This is a popular and battle tested web framework.

We currently use it for handling low level http (requests, responses, headers,
etc).

### helmet

This is collection of `Express` middlewares that ensures the bare
minimum security gotchas when it comes to web servers.

E.g.: It removes the `X-Powered-By` header from the http responses,
so we don't spoil what web framework we are using, preventing attackers to
apply tool specific sploits.

### http-status-codes

This is a simply tool to help readability of the HTTP status codes.
It provides all HTTP status through constants and also some util helpers.

E.g.: `HttpStatusCode.BAD_REQUEST`

### inversify

This is our <i>IoC container</i>.

Currently, we use it in our <i>Composition Root</i> in the main layer, to
handle creation of instances and their scopes.

### reflect-metadata

This is a peer dependency of `inversify` and it's necessary to
perform runtime reflection on types.

### tsconfig-paths

This library allow us use to use TypeScript path aliases in production, so our
transpiled JavaScript files know how to resolve the path aliased modules at
runtime.

E.g.: `import SignUpUseCase from '@data/usecases';`

### yup

This is validation library based in schemas.

It's very useful at our <i>Presentation Layer</i> where we do the schema
validation of the inputs.

Remember, it's only <b>Schema</b> validation, not <b>Domain</b> validation.

Domain validation like verify uniqueness of an email is done at the `Data Layer`.

## Development tools

<ToolsTable type="dev" />

### @redocly/openapi-cli

This is used to lint our OpenAPI specs.

### @types/bcrypt

Type definitions for `bcrypt`

### @types/express

Type definitions for `express`

### @types/jest

Type definitions for `jest`

### @types/node

Type definitions for `node`

### @types/shelljs

Type definitions for `shelljs`

### @types/supertest

Type definitions for `supertest`

### @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin

An ESLinst plugin to lint TypeScript syntax.

### @typescript-eslint/parser

The parser for `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`.

### eslint

A linter enfoce a code style.

### eslint-config-airbnb-base

A config to make ESLint respect the AirBnB styleguide.

### eslint-config-airbnb-typescript

A config that makes `esling-config-airbnb-base` work well with
TypeScript.

### eslint-config-prettier

An ESLint config that disables some rules so ESLint and Prettier can work
togheter.

### eslint-config-plugin-import

This is a peer dependency of `eslint-config-airbnb-typescript`

### factory.ts

This is a useful tool that generates a factory from an interface.

It works well with `faker` to generate test data.

### faker

A library to generate fake data. E.g.: names, emails, adresses, etc.

### jest

A test framework with everything included out of the box: test runner,
assertion API, mocking API, stubing API, etc.

### jest-mock-extended

A library that enhances `Jest`'s mocking API.

It can for example generate a deep mock, without having to create deep nested
dummy objects and functions

### prettier

A library to format the codebase.

### prisma

Prisma is currently the ORM to access relational databases.

### redoc-cli

This is used to generate REST API documentation (redoc) from our OpenAPI specs.

### shelljs

A tool useful to run cross-platform OS commands. Especially useful for
building build scripts.

### supertest

A library to perform integration tests without having to hit IO.

TL;DR: without having to spin up a web server to test its routes.

### ts-jest

A Jest transformer to execute tests using TypeScript.

### typescript

The typescript transpiler.
