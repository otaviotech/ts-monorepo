# Quick start

## Clone

First of all, clone the repository and install the root dependencies.

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:otaviotech/ts-monorepo.git
$ npm install
```

## Bootstrap packages

Now let Lerna take care of installing and linking the packages.

```sh
$ npm run bootstrap
```

## Commiting

### Overview

The root project has a setup containing Commitzen and CommitLint.

### Strategy

You should use conventional commits strategy to commit.

### Example (manual)

Let's say you've made some change to the `server` package.

Your commit message should be like:

```sh
$ git commit -m "feat(server): add a Stripe webhook to listen for invoice.paid events"
```

If you need to create a long commit message, use commitzen.

### Example (commitzen)

You can run the `commit` script on the root package:

```sh
$ npm run commit
```

### TL;DR

- Use the conventional commits convention.
- The scope of the commit should _ALWAYS_ be the package you've made changes to.
- Remember to make useful commits.
